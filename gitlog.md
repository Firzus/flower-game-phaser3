# Sets random initial starting pos for first flowers - 5/21/2019 - master - [f6e68e4ab915f2346b17e30f3cf20a707ed642e5](https://github.com/nodes777/flower-game-phaser3/commit/f6e68e4ab915f2346b17e30f3cf20a707ed642e5)

-   Changes exampleState.js positions to be determined by deteminePosition.js
    `const parent1XPos = determineXPos();`
-   Issues with defining screen size. `screenSize` is now defined in both index.js and exampleState.js
-   The goal was to ensure the bee always faced the correct direction regardless of flower spawn, however, this was already the case.
