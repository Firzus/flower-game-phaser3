# TO DO

-   Batch fillAvailableTiles calls to store as one single call
-   Set available tiles to be a formula
-   Fly Bee in 3D
-   Add back in save to local storage, check for existing data on load

## Tests

-   /components and /phaser

## Phaser

-   Multiple bees
-   The bee's movement is a hack that slows down performance
-   Weather/light via masks
-   On mouse hover display name (perf issues)
-   Refactor beeOnFlowerCollision to have the store passed in as an argument?

-   Create a table to display what's recessive (italices on FlowerTable and within the select for recessive)
-   Reuse drop down custom select structure for add recessive trait select?
-   Order the flower table genes to show the phenotype allele first, or only phenotype

## Features

-   Determine size of garden
