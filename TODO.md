## Tests

-   Figure out Jest

## Phaser

-   Multiple bees
-   Bee always angled to first flower no matter the spawn of the first flower
-   position determination from second flower
-   The bee's movement is a hack that slows down performance

## Redux

## React

-   Genericize punnett table to any given allele - add shape
-   Display table with rows for each flower and its genes - Factor out!
