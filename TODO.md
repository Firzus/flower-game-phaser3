## Redux

## React

-   Proptypes require gene in app to be one of the types in allTypes
-   Add Shape Icon like Color Square

## Features

-   Add recessive/dominant
-   Add wiggles/ animation
-   Save to localStorage,
-   Save to url to share somehow
-   Name Flowers and update their ids via redux
-   Changing the Punnett Table changes the game
