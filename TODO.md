-   Figure out initial flower position - currently random
-   Fly Bee in 3D

## Tests

-   /components and /phaser

## Phaser

-   Multiple bees

## Features

-   Determine size of garden
-   PreDetermine shape for garden to grow in?
    -   Break into tiles
    -   Fill in tiles as flowers are added
    -   Fractals or math formulas to determine garden shape
-   Add growth stages
-   Add wiggles/ animation (Get art direction sorted first)
-   Save to url to share somehow
